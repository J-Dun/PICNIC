This README_SIMPLE is for manually generating baselines and 
testing via already checked out picnic and Chombo.
(Such as would be used by developer prior to checking in.)

See README for generating baselines and testing
via an automated clean checkout of picnic and Chombo. 
(Such as would be used for nightly regression testing.)

------------------------------
To generate baseline solutions
------------------------------

- Copy the following files to a new directory:
    generate_baselines_simple.sh 
- Customize generate_baselines.sh as necessary
    (eg., set paths to picnic and Chombo dirs)
- Execute generate_baselines_simple.sh 
    (eg., "source generate_baselines_simple.sh > log.txt &")

------------------------------
Running tests
------------------------------

- Copy the following files to a new directory:
    run_tests_simple.sh 
- Customize run_tests_simple.sh as necessary:
    (eg., set paths to picnic and Chombo dirs)
    (eg., set paths to baselines and set the diff tolerance)
- Execute run_tests_simple.sh
    (eg., "source run_tests_simple.sh > log.txt &")
