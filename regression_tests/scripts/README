This README is for generating baselines and testing
via an automated clean checkout of picnic and Chombo. 
(Such as would be used for nightly regression testing.)

See README_SIMPLE for manually generating baselines and 
testing via already checked out picnic and Chombo.
(Such as would be used by developer prior to checking in.)

It is assumed that you have password-less 
(i.e., through HTTPS or SSH keys) access 
to the PICNIC repository.

------------------------------
To generate baseline solutions
------------------------------

- Copy the following files to a new directory:
    generate_baselines.sh 
    get_picnic.sh
- Customize generate_baselines.sh as necessary
  (eg., PICNIC  branch to generate baselines from)
- Execute generate_baselines.sh (you may need
  to change permissions to executable).

------------------------------
Running tests
------------------------------

- Copy the following files to a new directory:
    run_tests.sh 
    get_picnic.sh
- Customize run_tests.sh as necessary:
  + Specify the branch you want to test (PICNIC_BRANCH)
  + Provide the location of the baselines 
    (PICNIC_TESTS_BASELINES_LOC)
- Execute run_tests.sh (you may need to change 
  permissions to executable).
